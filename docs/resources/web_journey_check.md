# endpointmonitor_web_journey_check (Resource)

Create and manage web journey checks that can be set up to navigate through a website and perform period checks to ensure page elements, network calls and console logs are there or not as expected.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example Web Journey Check that uses the endpointmonitor_check_host 
# and endpointmonitor_check_group data sources to get the id of the 
# group it sits in and the host it is to run on.
# Additionally uses the endpointmonitor_web_journey_common_step 
# data source to apply a common journey step.
